                        Dino Šišić, Computer Science bachelor at IUS. Born and raised in Zenica, 
                        currently stationed in Sarajevo. Through my whole life I have been engaged 
                        in all kind of different social, cultural and sport activities that helped 
                        me grow into a person I am now. My constant seeking for engagement in society 
                        has helped me acquire a range of different skills that can be applied in 
                        different areas of life. Never have I been scared to explore new and unknown. 
                        My current occupation is faculty and improving my IT skills, but I would like 
                        to expand on some other areas as well. My ambition in life is to give as much 
                        as I can to my family and society.
